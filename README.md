# ESP32-Transmitter-TX-RX-for-a-Long-Range-Drone-RC-System
This sketch transforms an ESP32 into a high-frequency, long-range remote control transmitter for custom drone or RC applications. It leverages the ESP-NOW protocol along with the Long Range (LR) mode capability of the ESP32's Wi-Fi radio to achieve extended communication range with improved packet success rates compared to standard Wi-Fi.
